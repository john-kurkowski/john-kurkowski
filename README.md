# üëã I'm John!

I‚Äôm a full stack web developer, frontend-leaning. I‚Äôm obsessed with UX, DX, and
raising team capability. With 14+ years in the game, I help teams ship
incrementally, without rewrites. Test to serve the team, not a metric. Debug any
app, existing or legacy. I tend to work in TypeScript and Python.

Here on GitHub, you can find me maintaining the following projects.
