# üëã I'm John!

I‚Äôm a full stack web developer, frontend-leaning. I‚Äôm obsessed with UX, DX, and
raising team capability. With 14+ years in the game, I help teams ship
incrementally, with test coverage confidence, without rewrites. Debug any app,
existing or legacy. Collaborate on distributed teams via docs, code review, and
mentorship. I tend to work in TypeScript and Python, and I love learning new
tech.

Here on GitHub, you can find me maintaining the following projects.
