# 👋 I'm John

I’m a full stack web developer, leaning toward frontend, **user experience
(UX)** development. With 14+ years of experience, I'm passionate about users,
code quality, and raising the capability of the team. I tend to work in
TypeScript and Python.

Here on GitHub, you can find me maintaining
[tldextract](https://github.com/john-kurkowski/tldextract), a Python library to
parse URLs, and [music](https://github.com/john-kurkowski/music), a Python CLI
to publish my music.

When I’m not coding, I mix beats and cocktails. 🍸
