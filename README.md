# 👋 I'm John

I’m a full stack web developer, leaning toward frontend, **user experience
(UX)** development. With 14+ years of experience, I'm passionate about users,
code quality, and raising the capability of the team. I tend to work in
TypeScript and Python.

Here on GitHub, you can find me maintaining the following projects.

| [tldextract](https://github.com/john-kurkowski/tldextract) |
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/tldextract.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/tldextract)
| A Python library to parse URLs | |
[music](https://github.com/john-kurkowski/music) | | A Python CLI to publish my
music |

When I’m not coding, I mix beats and cocktails. 🍸
